# digit_recognition_kaggle
In this jupyter I'm trying to solve digit recognizer kaggle competition (https://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer)

Best kaggle score: 0.97085 

Best kaggle position: 1773/2493


There are 2 notebooks in this project:

digit_recognition_ml: 
 will use ML classical model with reduction feature with PCA, I will experiment Pipeline operation with Grid Search

keras_dl: 
 will only focus on Deep learning through Keras
